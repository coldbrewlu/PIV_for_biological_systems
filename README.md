# PIV_for_mechanobiology
This algorithm utilises openPIV python package for analysing the collective movements of particles in biological systems, such as granuloma cells in a follicle.

PIV_main.ipynb contains code for generating:
(a) velocity field video;
(b) velocity distribution histogram.

The folder imageJ_macro_code contains macro code that performs the following function:
(a) auto brightness & contrast;
(b) brightness adjustment;
(c) adjust contrast and despeckle;
(d) cropping images;
(e) FFT bandpass filter;
(f) combine image sequence into stack.

To run the code, download the code from the repository and run it on any IDE that supports ipynb files.
